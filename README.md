Wordle solver run instruction:

The script outputs the first word to enter into wordle.
It then waits for the output. Please enter the output as 5 digits 
separated by commas, where 0 - gray (mistake), 1 - yellow (wrong placement),
2 - green (correct). 
For example, if the true word is 'LABEL' and you entered 'WALES', 
wordle will show:
grey, green, yellow, green, grey

and you should write in the terminal:
02120

The script will then output the next word to give to wordle and so on.

Good luck!
